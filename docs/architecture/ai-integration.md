## AI Components

### Frontend Components

- **AI Interface**: User-facing components for interacting with AI features
- **Prompt Builder**: Constructs effective prompts based on user input and context
- **Response Processor**: Parses and formats AI-generated content for the application

### Backend Components (FastAPI)

- **AI Service**: Manages communication with external AI models
- **Prompt Templates**: Pre-defined templates for different types of content generation
- **Content Validator**: Ensures AI-generated content meets quality standards
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance by caching similar requests

### External AI Service

- **GenAI Model**: Large language model that generates content
- **Content Moderation**: Ensures generated content is appropriate and safe

## AI Features

### Automatic Flashcard Generation

Users can generate flashcards automatically from:

- Text passages
- Word lists
- Images with text
- Audio content
- Example sentences

The AI analyzes the input and creates appropriate question-answer pairs based on the selected template.

### Content Personalization

The AI personalizes content based on:

- User proficiency level
- Learning history
- Personal interests
- Learning goals

### Learning Optimization

The AI helps optimize the learning process by:

- Suggesting related content
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Recommending review strategies
- Providing personalized feedback

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte components for AI interactions
- **Backend**: FastAPI for AI service endpoints
- **AI Models**: Integration with external language models
- **Data Storage**: AI-related data stored in dedicated collections

### Data Flow

1. User provides input for flashcard generation
2. Frontend constructs a prompt using templates and context
3. Backend processes the request and calls the external AI service
4. AI generates content based on the prompt
5. Backend validates and processes the response
6. Frontend displays the generated flashcards for user review
7. User can edit, approve, or regenerate content
8. Approved flashcards are saved to the database

## Privacy and Ethics

BlendSphere's AI integration is designed with privacy and ethics in mind:

- User data is handled according to GDPR guidelines
- AI-generated content is filtered for appropriateness
- Users maintain control over generated content
